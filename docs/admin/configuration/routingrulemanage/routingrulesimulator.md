## Routing Rules Simulator

The **Routing Rules Simulator** in iTextPRO is a powerful diagnostic tool that helps you simulate and visualize the best-matching **MT (Mobile-Terminated)** routing rules. This simulation allows users to test routing logic without sending actual SMS traffic, ensuring the configuration meets their delivery and business goals.

### Simulation Details

To begin the simulation, provide the following parameters:

- **User**: Select the user account for which you want to simulate routing rules.
- **Enter Source**: Input the **Sender ID** or **Originator Address**.
- **Enter Destination**: Provide the **mobile number** (Destination Address) to test routing.
- **Done Date**: Choose the date for which the routing rules should be simulated. This helps identify date-specific routing logic (if applicable).

### Find All Routes

Once the required fields are filled, click on **"Find All Routes"**.

- iTextPRO will display a **list of best-matching MT routing rules**.
- The applicable rule is **highlighted** to indicate which routing rule would be applied based on the current configuration and inputs.
- The **date filter** ensures only routing rules active during the specified date are considered.

### Benefits

- üîç **Preview Routing Logic**: Easily inspect which routing rule is triggered for a given user, sender, and recipient combination.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Validate Configurations**: Ensure dynamic routing logic is correctly configured without live traffic.
- üß† **Optimize Delivery**: Understand how traffic is routed and adjust rules to improve delivery rates and reduce costs.
