## Manage Services

The **Manage Services** section in iTextPRO provides visibility into the various **background and foreground services** that drive the core functionalities of the platform. This interface is primarily intended for expert users or administrators.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Caution:** While it is possible to stop or start a service from the web interface, this should be done **with extreme caution**, particularly during peak load times, as it may result in **data loss** or **service disruption**.
