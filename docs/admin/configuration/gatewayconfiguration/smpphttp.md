### Configuration

## SMPP Gateways (MO/MT)

The **iTextPRO Application** prioritizes a **user-friendly experience** through a flexible design interface and a simplified configuration workflow. The goal is to move away from CLI complexities and immerse application owners in a **Graphic User Interface (GUI)**-based environment. An integrated **Communicator Engine** handles all backend commands, streamlining your operational tasks.

The **"Manage Gateway"** feature empowers users to handle connectivity with external **Short Message Service Centers (SMSCs)** via **SMPP** and **HTTP** protocols.

For **SMPP**, a **single bind** enables Mobile-Originated (MO), Mobile-Terminated (MT), and Delivery Reports (DLR) operations. iTextPRO supports **multiple SMPP Gateways**, allowing for **redundancy** and **cost-effective routing**.

Configure SMPP Gateway properties in iTextPRO for optimal performance:

1. **Keep Alive (Seconds):**  
   Interval for *Enquire Link* to keep session alive.

2. **Gateway Open Time / Close Time:**  
   Define operational hours, often used to comply with **Do Not Disturb** policies.

3. **Gateway Encoding:**  
   Character set selection compatible with the telco/SMSC.

4. **Convert Message-ID:**  
   Allows conversion between **Decimal ‚Üî Hex** Message-ID formats for accurate DLRs.

5. **Time Zone:**  
   All reports will reflect this selected time zone.

6. **Stop Loss Price:**  
   Sets the **max allowed gateway cost** when using blind routing.

7. **Throughput per Second (TPS):**  
   Define based on vendor capacity.  
   **Formula:** `Messages per second √ó Sessions`

- **TON (Type of Number):**  
  Select as per SMSC documentation (e.g., International, Alphanumeric, etc.)

- **NPI (Numbering Plan Indicator):**  
  Indicates numbering standard in use (E.164, ISDN, etc.)

- **Session Setup:**  
  Configure Tx, Rx, and TxR sessions per vendor allocation.

### üß∑ Roles & Routing

![Gateway Roles](images/httpgateway5.png)

- **Is Active:**  
  Marks the gateway as live and ready to route traffic.

- **Is Default:**  
  Only one gateway can be marked as default. Messages without matching routes go here.

- **Is Async:**  
  Enables **asynchronous mode** for faster message submissions.

- **Blind Routing:**  
  Allows message submission to countries **without defined cost prices**.

üìå **Note:**  
After configuration, clicking **"Save"** sends an **on-the-fly bind request** ‚Äî no manual restart required.
