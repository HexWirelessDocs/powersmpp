# Audit Logs

The **Audit Logs** feature in iTextPRO records a **comprehensive audit trail** of various events performed by both **Admin** and **User Accounts**.  
It ensures transparency, accountability, and security by tracking critical system activities such as **password recovery**, **property edits/updates/deletes**, and **Sender ID** or **template requests**.

- **IP Address** – Logs the IP address from which the action originated.
