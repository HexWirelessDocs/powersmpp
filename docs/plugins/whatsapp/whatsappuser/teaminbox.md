# Team Inbox

The **Team Inbox** provides a centralized platform to monitor and manage all customer interactions, whether handled by a human agent or a chatbot.  

As an **Admin**, you have full visibility into all chats and can easily take over any ongoing conversation from an agent or chatbot, ensuring a seamless customer experience.

Each agent has a **unique login**, which limits access to their assigned chats and safeguards sensitive customer information.
