## Rule Configuration

To ensure your webchats are efficiently routed, you can create custom rules using the following parameters:

1. **Rule Name**  
   Give your rule a clear and descriptive name for easy identification.

2. **Scope**  
   - **Connector**: Select the specific webchat connector for which you want to apply the rule.  
   - **Time Frame**: Define the specific time period during which the rule should be active.

3. **Logic**  
   - **Payload Type**: Route messages based on the type of content (text, image, etc.).  
   - **Payload Text**: Route based on specific keywords or phrases in the message.  
   - **Payload Caption**: Route based on the caption of image or video messages.  
   - **Sender Information**: Route based on the sender's details (e.g., name, phone number).  
   - **Logical Operators**: Combine multiple conditions using **AND** or **OR** logic.

4. **Fulfillment**  
   - **Agent Routing**: Direct the chat to a specific agent or agent group.  
   - **Bot Routing**: Route the chat to a chatbot for automated responses.

By carefully configuring these rules, you can optimize your webchat operations, improve response times, and enhance customer satisfaction.
